# Recode

`recode` is built to recode an entire media library, preferrably without making
a massive pain out of it.

Usage is best checked by using `--help`.


## Dependencies

Currently, just `rich` is a dependency. I will, at some point, make this
properly packaged. Dont count on it for a while as this is mostly for private
usage.
